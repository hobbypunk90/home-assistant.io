This component allows you to send messages to [Google Hangouts](http://hangouts.google.com) conversations, as well as to react to messages in conversations. Reacting to commands is accomplished by firing an event when one of the configured commands is triggered.

## {% linkable_title Setup the component via the frontend %}

Menu: *Configuration* -> *Integrations*
  
Fill the form:
* Your **Google Mail Address** and **Password**
* If needed, you will be asked for a 2-factor authorization token

**BEST PRACTICE:** You can't write messages to yourself or get notifications in a group, if "you" write message. The best way is to create a own google account for your hangouts bot.

**IMPORTANT:** If you secured your account with 2 factor authorization: Only verification by app or SMS are supported. There is no support for verification by prompt on your phone.

**IMPORTANT 2:** If you are sure your email and password is correct, but the component says the login is invalid. Wait a few hours and try it again, it meight be, that google asks for a captcha which we can't support. Google official don't support bots at hangouts, that's why we have to work around this.

The authentication token will be generated and stored internally.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
hangouts:
  commands:
    - word: testword
      conversations:
        - id: CONVERSATION_ID1
        - id: CONVERSATION_ID2
    - expression: "My name is (?P<name>.*)"
      name: introduction
```
{% configuration %}
commands:
  description: "A list of commands that the bot should listen for. If a command is triggered (via its *word* or *expression*, see below), an event is fired that you can handle using automations. Every command consists of these possible configuration options:"
  required: false
  type: map
  default: empty
  keys:
    word:
      description: "Specifies a word that the bot should listen for. If you specify 'my_command' here, the bot will react to any message starting with 'my_command'."
      required: false
      type: string
    expression:
      description: "Specifies a regular expression (in python regexp syntax) that the bot should listen to. The bot will react to any message that matches the regular expression."
      required: false
      type: string
    name:
      description: "The name of the command. This will be an attribute of the event that is fired when this command triggers."
      required: true
      type: string
    conversations:
      description: "A list of conversations that the bot should listen for this command in. If this is not given, all conversations are used."
      required: false
      type: [map]
      default: empty
      keys:
        id:
          description: "Specifies the id of the conversation. *The conversation id can be obtained from the `hangouts.conversations` entity.*"
          required: true
          type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

The conversations has to be precreated, the conversation id can be obtained from the `hangouts.conversations` entity. Make sure to use quotes around the conversation id or alias to escape special characters (`!`, and `#`) in YAML.

### {% linkable_title Event Data %}

If a command is triggered, a `hangouts_command` event is fired. The event contains the name of the command in the `command` field.

If the command is a word command, the `data` field contains a list of the command's arguments, i.e., everything that stood behind the word, split at spaces. If the command is an expression command, the `data` field contains the [group dictionary](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/re.html?highlight=re#re.match.groupdict) of the regular expression that matched the message.

There are these additional fields: `conversation_id`, `user_id` and `user_name`.

### {% linkable_title Comprehensive Configuration Example %}

```yaml
# The Hangouts component
hangouts:
  commands:
    - word: testword
      conversations:
        - name: "someothertest"
    - expression: "My name is (?P<name>.*)"
      name: introduction

automation:
  - alias: 'React to !testword'
    trigger:
      platform: event
      event_type: hangouts_command
      event_data:
        command: testword
    action:
      service: hangouts.send_message
      data_template:
        target: 
          - name: "hasstest"
        message: 
          - text: 'It looks like you wrote testword'
  - alias: 'React to an introduction'
    trigger:
      platform: event
      event_type: hangouts_command
      event_data:
        command: introduction
    action:
      service: hangouts.send_message
      data_template:
        target: 
          - id: '{{ trigger.event.data.conversation_id}}'
        message: 
          - text: "Hello {{ trigger.event.data.data.name }}"

```

This configuration will:
- Listen for "testword" in the room "someothertest" (and only) there. 
  If such a message is encountered, it will answer with "It looks like you wrote testword" into the "hasstest" conversation.
- Listen in all conversations for any message matching "My name is (any name)" and answer with "Hello (the given name)" into the same conversation.
